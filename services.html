                        Organizations have both engineering and business processes in place, but are 
                        disconnected because of different goals or different owner departments

                    <blockquote>
                        Sometimes, engineering companies have most of the design systems in place, but 
                        important bridges may be missing. They may be in form of connection between two 
                        systems or translation, automation or specialization. Engenext builds such bridges 
                        with an aim to make the whole system seamless

                    <blockquote>
                        Design engineers may have envisioned a concept that is yet to be realized. Engenext 
                        helps realize visions through brain-storming, innovation and quick implementation
